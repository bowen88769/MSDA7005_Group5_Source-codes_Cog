Option a follows as it aligns with her background in social justice. Option d is next, as it suggests she is involved in feminism but not a bank teller. Option c is less likely due to the conjunction fallacy, as it combines two specific traits. Finally, option b is the least likely, as it does not align with her described interests and background.\n",
