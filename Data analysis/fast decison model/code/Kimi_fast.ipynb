Option d is also probable because it is consistent with Linda's interests but does not preclude her from having a job unrelated to her activism. Option e is likely as it covers the possibility of Linda being involved in the feminist movement, which seems more probable than her being a bank teller.

      "1. **Reasons for Selection Order:** Linda's background in philosophy, activism, and social justice aligns closely with feminist activism, making it the most likely scenario. The combination of two specific and unrelated roles (feminist and bank teller) is less likely due to the conjunction fallacy. The scenario of Linda not being a bank teller but being active in the feminist movement is more plausible than the reverse, as the description provides no financial sector inclination. The \"either/or\" option is broad and covers multiple possibilities, making it more likely than the specific conjunction of both roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Steps:** I started by considering Linda's characteristics and background. The description of Linda being outspoken, smart, and concerned with social justice fits the profile of someone active in the feminist movement, which is why option 'a' is ranked highest. Option 'e' is ranked second because it encompasses both possibilities of Linda being involved in the feminist movement or working as a bank teller, covering more ground. Option 'd' follows as it is more likely that Linda would be involved in activism rather than working as a bank teller, given her described interests. Option 'c' is less likely due to the conjunction fallacy—assigning higher probability to two specific and unrelated events happening together than to either event alone. Lastly, option 'b' is the least likely because it does not align with Linda's described interests and activities.\n",
