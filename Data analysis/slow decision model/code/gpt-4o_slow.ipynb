Statement (d) is less likely than (a) because it specifies that she is not a bank teller, adding a constraint. Statement (b) that she is a bank teller is less consistent with her description, making it less likely.

      "1. **Reasons for Selection Order:** In the context of the Linda Problem, a is most likely because Linda's background suggests strong involvement in feminist movements. Option e is broader and thus more probable than the conjunctions. Option d is plausible but less so than either a or e alone, as it specifies non-involvement in banking. Option b is less likely based on Linda's profile, while c is the least likely due to the conjunction fallacy — it combines two specific events, making it less probable than any individual part.\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Steps:** Begin by analyzing Linda's characteristics, which align with a feminist profile. Recognize that broader conditions (e) are more probable than specific conjunctions or exclusions. Assess each statement against the probability theory, leading to the recognition that single conditions (a, b) and disjunctions (e) are generally more likely than conjunctions (c, d). Thus, the logical ranking from most to least probable is established.\n",

      "1. **Reasons for Selection Order:** Option (a) is ranked highest due to Linda's background and interests aligning with the feminist movement. Option (e) is more likely than (d), as it accommodates more possibilities. Option (d) follows because Linda's described interests suggest activism but not necessarily employment in specific sectors. (b) is less likely due to the absence of relevant evidence linking her to a bank teller role. Finally, (c) is the least likely because the conjunction fallacy shows that two conditions combined are less probable than a single one.\n",
