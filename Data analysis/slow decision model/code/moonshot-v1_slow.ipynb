      "1. **Reasons for Selection Order:** The Linda problem is an example of a cognitive bias known as the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to judge the probability of two events occurring together as more likely than the probability of a single event occurring. Given Linda's background and interests, the probability of her being active in the feminist movement (a) is higher than her being a bank teller (b). The disjunction (e), which states that Linda is either active in the feminist movement or working as a bank teller, is the most likely scenario because it encompasses both possibilities. The conjunction (c) of being both active in the feminist movement and working as a bank teller is less likely than either event alone due to the conjunction fallacy.

      "   - The Linda problem is a classic example of cognitive bias where people tend to rank the conjunction of two events (c) as more likely than just one of the events (a). However, using logical reasoning, we know that the probability of \"Linda is both active in the feminist movement and is working as a bank teller\" (c) cannot be higher than the probability of \"Linda is active in the feminist movement\" (a) alone. The same logic applies to \"Linda is active in the feminist movement but is not working as a bank teller\" (d). The probability of \"Linda is either active in the feminist movement or working as a bank teller\" (e) is the highest because it includes all the possibilities of a or b. \"Linda is working as a bank teller\" (b) is the least likely because it does not align with the given description of Linda.\n",
