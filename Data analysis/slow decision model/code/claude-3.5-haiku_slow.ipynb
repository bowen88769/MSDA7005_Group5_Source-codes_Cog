      "1. **Reasons for Selection Order:** Option e is the most likely because it encompasses both possibilities (active in the feminist movement or working as a bank teller), making it the broadest statement. Option a is likely as it aligns with Linda's background in social justice. Option d is plausible as it suggests she is active in the feminist movement without being a bank teller. Option c is less likely because it combines two specific roles, which is a narrower scenario. Option b is the least likely as it does not align with her described interests and background.\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Steps:** I first evaluated the general likelihood of each statement based on Linda's characteristics and background. I considered the implications of each statement and how they relate to her interests and activities.

Option a is ranked second due to Linda's background in philosophy and her concern with social justice issues, which might align with feminist values. Option d is a subset of option a and is ranked third. Option b is ranked fourth as there is no information provided that would suggest Linda is working as a bank teller.
